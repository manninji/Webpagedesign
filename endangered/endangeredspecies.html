		<h3>Discovery of the Malayan Tapir</h3>
	</br>
		<p>The Malayan tapir is becoming very endangered and close to extinct. In 1984, an all-black tapir was sent to Rotterdam Zoo and was considered a subspecies called Tapirus indicus breventianus after its discoverer, Captain K. Brevet.
		It is believed that Tapirs haven't changed much over tens of millions of years.In the Malay language, the tapir is commonly referred to as cipan, tenuk or badak tampung.
		They are covered in an unusal pattern which is used for camouflage. They were once found throughout the tropical lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>

		<h3>About the Malayan Tapir</h3>
	</br>
		<p>The Malayan Tapir is the biggest of the five other species of Tapirs. Tapirs have poor eyesight but have outstanding hearing and sense of smell. 
		They can live up to 30 years in the wild and in captivity. Malayan tapirs are about 6 to 8 ft in length and they stand about 3 to 3.5 ft tall, 
		they weigh on average 550 to 700 pounds with the females usually being larger than the males. The tapir uses its nose to grab leaves from tree branches or to pick up fruit that has fallen.
		Tapirs are skilled swimmer and divers. They can dive under water to feed on aquatic plants. They feed mostly on grasses, leaves, buds, twigs, aquatic plants and fruit. 
		Tapirs have a gestation period of 13 months and gives birth to one calf per gestation.</p>

		<h3>Conservation</h3>
		<p>The Malayan tapir is currently classified as endangered. This classification is mainly due to the continuous decrease of the population from habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and increased adult death from hunting, roadkills and bi-catches from snare hunters.
	</br>
		<h4>Habitat loss and fragmentation:</h4>
		<p>Most of the remaining Malayan tapirs can be found in three distinct sub-populations:
		Thailand-Myanmar: Here, the population is relatively protected due to national parks and reserves.
		South Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia
		Sumatra including southern and central parts. Although all three areas have established protected reserves, the three sub-populations are becoming more isolated due to human activity. 
		In Sumatra it has been estimated that there has been a 40% decline in forest cover over the past 15 years, and at the current rate of decline all forest outside conservation areas will be lost over the next few decades.
		The lost of viable habitat is already having a devastating effect on the Malayan tapir. It is estimated that there has been a 50% population loss in the past three generations and that there are less than 2,500 mature individuals remaining. 
		The fragmentation of habitat also puts the species at great risk of inbreeding.</p>
