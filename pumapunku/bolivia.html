<h4>Below are reviews from some of the travelers that loved Puma Punku:</h4>
<blockquote><q>It is the best site EVER! This was my #1 bucket list item and it did not disappoint.</q></blockquote>
<blockquote><q>To see this site with your own eyes is unnerving. To think that these granite blocks have been laying here since Lake Titicaca overwhelmed this area, maybe 12,000 years ago, is just crazy to imagine.</q></blockquote>
<blockquote><q>Hitched across the border, to Tiwanaku; waited 38 years to get here, and it was worth it!</q>
